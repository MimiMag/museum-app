# Step 02: JavaScript - Complex data

## Learning Goals
* [ ] The student recognizes complex data structures (arrays, nested objects, etc)
* [ ] The student understands you can fetch data from other apis and can implement code examples we give to fetch some data. (Not do it themselves, only understand what, not necessarily how!)
* [ ] The student can use an iterator to create elements on the page with content from the array
* [ ] The student knows the proper terms to discuss their work:
    * Array, elements
    * Api
    * callback (in iterator)

# Modules
  * Arrays
    * Select, add, push
    * iterators
  * Loops
  * communicating between apps
    * Apis
    * Request
    * Fetch
    * (Promise?)
  

## Assignments
* Inspect the Example page 
    * (change styles, views, etc)
* Style the index page step by step (mostly copy paste)
* Style the detail page yourself
