# My Museum App

Welcome to your very first project! In this project, we will be introducing you to all important concepts that you need to know about to build a front end app. 

The front end or _client side_ of an app, is the part of your app that the user sees and interacts with: everything you see on the screen. It is one of the three main parts of any sort of (web)app:

![DB > Back End > Front End]()

Your final app will look something like [this](linkToDeployedVersionOfApp):

## What you won't build

This is app might look like complete app to you, however, there are a couple of important things your app can't do. 

First of all, it _can't store any data_. Even though you can add likes or comments, once you refresh the page, everything will be reset. To store data, you need to use a _database_.

Secondly, this app is not very safe! All data and all the code that we will write will be visible to and adjustable by anyone. To limit data access to specific users, you need a _back end_.

## Developer Tools
Besides the main concepts to build a front end app, we will also be introducing you to some important tools for developers, such as Chrome Dev Tools, Git and Github.

By the end of this project, you should feel confident you could build a similar app all by yourself!
