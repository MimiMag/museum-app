## ✏️ Exercises
### Setting Up your HTML Page
It is time to start for real! Let's set up your basic frame work of your HTML page and open it in the browser!

1. In your terminal, navigate into your `museum-app` directory:
![navigate to project](https://cd.sseu.re/1._mimiCodaisseursMBP2_codaisseurweek-1museum-app_zsh_2018-11-28_17-46-22.png)

2. Because we are starting on a new part of our project, we will be creating a new branch. Create a new one and check it out with the command: `git checkout -b feat/index-page`:

![create new branch](https://cd.sseu.re/1._mimiCodaisseursMBP2_codaisseurweek-1museum-app_zsh_2018-11-28_17-49-37.png)

3. Open the `museum-app` project in visual studio code using `code .`

4. Click in the side bar and press `a` to create a new file. Call it `index.html`.

5. Add the `DOCTYPE` and `html` elements to your file by copying the following code:
 ```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  
</html>
```

6. Add a `head`- element and a `body` element between your `html` opening and closing tag.

7. Inside your `head`- element, add a `title` element with the content: 'Museum Guide'.

8. In your browser press `cmd + o` or `ctrl o` to open a new file. Select `index.html` in your project:

> ## 👌 Pro-tip
> Not sure where to find your file? In your terminal, in your project directory, print the working directory with `pwd`!

9. Your page should look like this:
![Result](https://cd.sseu.re/Museum_Guide_2018-11-28_18-01-35.png)

> ## 😱  Sanity Check
> Your code should now look like this:
>```html
><!DOCTYPE html>
><html>
>  <head>
>    <title>Museum Guide</title>
>  </head>
>  <body>
>
>  </body>
></html>
>```
