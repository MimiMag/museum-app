## Assignments
* Create (init) a new git repository
* Copy the example page's HTML, then open and inspect the example page 
    * (change innerHTML, use devTools to find... etc)
* Follow the steps we offer to build the structure of the index page (html only - all data is hardcoded!)
* Create an empty repository on GitHub and push the local repository to it (using the instructions on GH)
* Inspect the 'detail page' and build it yourself
