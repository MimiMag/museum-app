### Inspect the HTML of a page
Before you start writing your own code, we'll check how to inspect and experiment with the HTML of a page using your Chrome Dev Tools. In this way you can always check out examples of other pages, but also inspect whether your browser interprets your code as you expected.

1. Go to the [example page](), right click on the title and click `inspect`. This should open your _Chrome DevTools_.

2. In your DevTools find the element that you selected. It should be selected for you:

3. Open the `<section>` under the `<h1>` element by clicking on the triangle next to it. How many anchor tags do you see?

4. Where can you find the image tags? Do you see their attributes? What are their names? What are their values?

5. What is inside the footer?

6. Click on the three dots next to `<h1>` element that you inspected before. Choose `Edit as HTML`:
